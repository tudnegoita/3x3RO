(In progress)
A full stack application that provides users the possibility of creating an amateur 3x3 basketball club as well as searching, editing and deleting clubs. Its purpose is to help the user find other basketball players.
For the frontend part I have used a bootstrap template and thymeleaf.
For the backend I have used Spring MVC.
For storing the data I have used a PostgreSQL database.
